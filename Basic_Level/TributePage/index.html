    <h3>Some of my favorite quotes from this man:</h3>
    <q>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.</q>
    <br><br>
    <q>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know what you truly want to become.</q>
    <br><br>
    <q>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</q>
