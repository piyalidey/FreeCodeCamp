/* Bonfire: Validate US Telephone Numbers

Return true if the passed string is a valid US phone number

The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it is a valid US number. The

following are all valid formats for US numbers:
555-555-5555, (555)555-5555, (555) 555-5555, 555 555 5555, 5555555555, 1 555 555 5555

For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as "800-692-7753" or "8oo-
six427676;laskdjf". Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination
of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must
confirm that the country code is "1". Return true if the string is a valid US phone number;
otherwise false.

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

function telephoneCheck(str) {
   var regex = /^(1\s?)?(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})[\s\-]?\d{3}[\s\-]?\d{4}$/;
   return regex.test(str);
}
telephoneCheck("555-555-5555");


/* Code Explanation:

^ denotes the beginning of the string (1\s?)? checks allows for a "1" or a "1 " at the beginning.

\d{n} checks for exactly n number of digits so (\(\d{3}\)|\d{3}) checks for three digits that are allowed to be between parenthesis.

[\s\-]? checks for spaces or dashes between the groups of digits.

$ denotes the end of the string. In this case the beginning and end of the string are used in the regex to prevent it from matching any longer string
that might contain a valid phone number (eg. "s 555 555 5555 a").

Lastly we use regex.test(str) to test if the string adheres to the regular expression and return true or false.*/
