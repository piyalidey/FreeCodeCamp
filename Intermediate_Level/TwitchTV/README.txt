Use Twitch TV's JSONP API to build a streaming app. 

User Stories:
1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
3. if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
4. I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

Hint:
1. See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Front-End-Project-Use-Twitchtv-JSON-API.
2. The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel.
