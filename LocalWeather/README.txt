This is an app to show Local weather in your browser. A Pen created at CodePen.io. 
You can find this one at http://codepen.io/pdey/full/vKdbmN/.

The Weather App that changes background according to the temperature and that lets you choose between Imperial and Metric 
systems. It uses the following APIs.
1. Forecast.io
2. Google API.

Note:
Google Chrome has deprecated the feature in version 50. If you tried to use it in chrome the error is:

"getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition() are deprecated on insecure origins. To use this feature, you should consider 
switching your application to a secure origin, such as HTTPS. 
See https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins 
for more details."

Alternatively, you could use some other browser like Firefox to see the app in effect.
